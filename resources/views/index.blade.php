        <h2>rules</h2>
        <p>1. Cite Your Sources
            It's highly likely that at some point while writing or blogging, you'll want to refer to an article or blog post that you read online.
            
            While it's possible to copy a phrase or a few words without violating copyright laws, to stay within the rules of fair use, attribute the source where that quote came from.
            
            You should do this by citing the original author's name and the website or blog name where the quote was originally used, along with a link to the original source.
        </p>
        <p>2. Disclose Paid Endorsements
            Bloggers need to be open and honest about any paid endorsements. If you are paid to use and review or promote a product, you should reveal it.
            
            The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates truth in advertising, publishes an extensive FAQ on this topic. These are the basics:
            
            Clearly label content that is advertising.
            Disclose affiliates. Either label links that drive your readers to your affiliates, or build a page that explains your affiliates and relationships with them.
            Don't pretend to be an objective third-party if you aren't. If you work for a company, state that fact in any content that refers to it or its products or services.
        </p>
        <p>3 Ask Permission
            While citing a few words or a phrase and attributing your source is acceptable under fair use laws, fair use laws as they pertain to online content are still a gray area in courtrooms.
            
            If you plan to copy more than a few words or phrases, it's best to err on the side of caution and ask the original author for permission to republish their words—with proper attribution—on your blog. Never plagiarize.
            
            Asking permission also applies to the use of photos and images on your blog. Unless a photo or image you plan to use comes from a source that clearly gives permission for you to use it on your blog, you must ask the original photographer or designer for permission to use it on your blog with proper attribution.
        </p>

            4 Publish a Privacy Policy
            Privacy is a concern for most people on the internet. You should publish a privacy policy and adhere to it. It may be as simple as "YourBlogName will never sell, rent, or share your email address."

            You may need a full page dedicated to this message, depending on how much information you collect from your readers.

            5 Play Nice
            Just because your blog is yours doesn't mean you have free rein to write anything you want without repercussions. The content on your blog is available for the world to see.

            Just as a reporter's written words or a person's verbal statements can be considered libel or slander, so can the words you use on your blog.

            Avoid legal entanglement by writing with a global audience in mind. You never know who might stumble upon your blog.

            If your blog accepts comments, respond to them thoughtfully. Don't get into arguments with your readers.
